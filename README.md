# Learning C language
learning c language bit by bit. This file will container notes gathered through the learning process. 

## Compiling

### Compiler
I'm starting out by using the most common compiler, gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) version 9.2.0 (tdm64-1).

### Targets

#### Windows PC
x86_64-w64-mingw32

### Basic compilation

The following command will compile the file `program.c` to binary (executable) `program.exe`
`gcc program.c -o program`
